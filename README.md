# Frontend Mentor - Stats Preview Card Solution

This is a solution to the [Stats preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

This was my second project and it was a little more difficult than the first. I wll explain more on why it was difficult in the [What I learned](#what-i-learned) section. Overall, I enjoyed this challenge and it showed me I have a lot to learn about making a responsive design.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge took way longer to complete compared to my first challenge. This was because I learned a great way to implement flexbox when I was probably 80% done with my original design. I knew I was just fudging my design by adjusting the margins and padding and I knew there was a better way.

I then came across a video by [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQAvjof1oe4) on YouTube where he gave an awesome explanation and demonstration on flexbox. This sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole on understanding flexbox and after I came out of the rabbit hole, I decided I wanted to introduce flexbox into this build.

This cause some things to break and I had to rework some of the things I did previously, but I think the experience was worth it. Not only was it worth it because it helped me complete the challenge of getting the page to be more responsive on mobile, but it also helped me think through "better ways" and some "best practices" with writing code.

There is still much to learn with flexbox, but I am glad I gave it a go this round. I look forward to implementing it more proficiently in the future.

### Continued development

I implemented `flexboxes` into this design, but I would like to get more proficient at using it. I experienced the potential flexbox has with this build, though I feel like this round I just tried things until I got it to work. I have to get a better understanding of how best to implement it in my overall design flow.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I learned a lot more about the `display: flex;` property on this go around and as always, MDN came in clutch.
- [Flexbox Design by Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQAvjof1oe4) - Kevin Powell gives a phenomenal breakdown of the `display: flex;` property. After watching his video I went back and implemented `display: flex;` immediately. I will definitely return to his video in the future for reference.
